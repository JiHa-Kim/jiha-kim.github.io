  I am using the Chirpy theme in Jekyll.

  For the metadata, you can have up to 2 levels of categories, e.g.:
    - Machine Learning
    - Mathematical Optimization
  For both tags and categories, please employ capitalization for distinction.

  For writing the posts, please use the Kramdown MathJax syntax.

  In regular Markdown, please use the following syntax:

  Inline equations are surrounded by dollar signs on the same line: $$inline$$

  Block equations are isolated by a newlines between the text above and below, and newlines between the delimiters and the equation (even in lists):

  $$
  block
  $$

  Use LaTeX commands for symbols as much as possible such as $$\vert$$ or $$\ast$$. For instance, please avoid using the vertical bar symbol, only use \vert for absolute value, and \Vert for norm.

  The syntax for lists is:
  1. $$inline$$ item
  2. item $$inline$$
  3. item

    $$
    block
    $$

    (continued) item
  4. item

  Inside HTML environments, like blockquotes, you must make sure to add the attribute `markdown="1"` to the opening tag. This will ensure that the syntax is parsed correctly.

  Blockquote classes are "prompt-info", "prompt-tip", "prompt-warning", and "prompt-danger".
