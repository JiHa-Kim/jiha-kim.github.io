Hi, I'm Ji-Ha. This site is my space for exploring concepts in Mathematics and Machine Learning that I find compelling. My primary motivation is to solidify my own understanding by articulating these ideas.

## What This Blog Is (and Isn't)

These posts are summary notes from an ongoing learning journey. I explore topics that interest me, aiming to break them down and share my perspective. You'll find mathematical explorations, mainly related to machine learning.

While I strive for clarity and accuracy, this is fundamentally a learning process shared publicly. My understanding evolves, and the posts reflect my grasp of the material *at the time of writing*.

**It's likely that explanations can be improved, nuances might be missed, or errors could be present.**

## Your Input is Welcome

If you have expertise in these areas, spot something that needs correction, or have suggestions for clarification:

*   **Please share your insights.** Feedback helps me learn and improves the quality of the content for everyone!
*   **Comments are enabled** on posts for discussion.

My hope is that these explorations might be useful to others on a similar path and that discussion can lead to a better collective understanding.
