Crash courses
    2. `Numerical Analysis`
    1. `Tensor Calculus`, which leads to:
        1. `Differential Geometry` (which then, along with Statistics and Information Theory, leads to `Information Geometry`)
        2. `Statistics and Information Theory` (which then, along with Differential Geometry, leads to `Information Geometry`)

        1. `Convex Analysis` (which then leads to `Online Learning`)
