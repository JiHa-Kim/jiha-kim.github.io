  I am using the Chirpy theme in Jekyll.

  For the metadata, you can have up to 2 levels of categories, e.g.:
    - Machine Learning
    - Mathematical Optimization
  For both tags and categories, please employ capitalization for distinction.

  NEVER introduce any non-existant URL or path, like an image.
  This causes build errors. For example, simply put image: # placeholder

  For writing the posts, please use the Kramdown MathJax syntax.

  In regular Markdown, please use the following syntax:

  - Inline equations are surrounded by dollar signs on the same line: $$inline$$

  - Block equations are isolated by newlines between the text above and below,
    and newlines between the delimiters and the equation (even in lists):
    text

    $$
    block
    $$

    text...
  Use LaTeX commands for symbols as much as possible (e.g. $$\vert$$ for
  absolute value, $$\ast$$ for asterisk). Avoid using the literal vertical bar
  symbol; use \vert and \Vert instead.

  The syntax for lists is:

  1. $$inline$$ item
  2. item $$inline$$
  3. item

      $$
      block
      $$

      (continued) item
  4. item

  Here are examples of syntaxes that do **not** work:

  1. text
    $$
    block
    $$
    text

  2. text
    $$
    text
    $$

    text

  And the correct way to include multiple block equations in a list item:

  1. text

    $$
    block 1
    $$

    $$
    block 2
    $$

    (continued) text

  Inside HTML environments, like blockquotes or details blocks, you **must** add the attribute
  `markdown="1"` to the opening tag so that MathJax and Markdown are parsed correctly.

  Here are some blockquote templates you can use:

  <blockquote class="box-definition" markdown="1">
  <div class="title" markdown="1">
  **Definition.** The natural numbers $$\mathbb{N}$$
  </div>
  The natural numbers are defined as $$inline$$.

  $$
  block
  $$

  </blockquote>

  And a details block template:

  <details class="details-block" markdown="1">
  <summary markdown="1">
  **Tip.** A concise title goes here.
  </summary>
  Here is content that can include **Markdown**, inline math $$a + b$$,
  and block math.

  $$
  E = mc^2
  $$

  More explanatory text.
  </details>

  Similarly, for boxed environments you can define:
    - box-definition          # Icon: `\f02e` (bookmark), Color: `#2563eb` (blue)
    - box-lemma               # Icon: `\f022` (list-alt/bars-staggered), Color: `#16a34a` (green)
    - box-proposition         # Icon: `\f0eb` (lightbulb), Color: `#eab308` (yellow/amber)
    - box-theorem             # Icon: `\f091` (trophy), Color: `#dc2626` (red)
    - box-example             # Icon: `\f0eb` (lightbulb), Color: `#8b5cf6` (purple) (for example blocks with lightbulb icon)
    - box-info                # Icon: `\f06a` (exclamation-circle), Color: `var(--prompt-info-icon-color)` (theme-defined)
    - box-tip                 # Icon: `\f0eb` (lightbulb, regular style), Color: `var(--prompt-tip-icon-color)` (theme-defined)
    - box-warning             # Icon: `\f06a` (exclamation-circle), Color: `var(--prompt-warning-icon-color)` (theme-defined)
    - box-danger              # Icon: `\f071` (exclamation-triangle), Color: `var(--prompt-danger-icon-color)` (theme-defined)

  For details blocks, use:
    - details-block           # main wrapper (styled like box-tip)
    - the `<summary>` inside will get tip/book icons automatically

  Please do not modify the sources, references, or further reading material
  without an explicit request.

- proposition: for matrix norms induced by vector norms
  - left rotationally invariant iff codomain uses Euclidean norm
  - right rotationally invariant iff domain uses Euclidean norm
- proposition: for matrix norms induced by inner product
  - one-sided rotational invariance (any) implies scalar multiple of Frobenius norm implies unitarily invariant
- theorem:
  - left unitarily invariant matrix norm iff depends only on row Gram matrix
  - right unitarily invariant matrix norm iff depends only on (column) Gram matrix
- theorem (Von Neumann): matrix norm unitarily invariant on both sides iff norm equals some symmetric gauge function of singular values
  - symmetric gauge function: norm axioms + invariant under elementwise absolute value and permutation
  - special case: all Schatten p-norms
