  I am using the Chirpy theme in Jekyll.
  Please use the Kramdown MathJax syntax.

  In regular Markdown, please use the following syntax:

  Inline equations are surrounded by dollar signs on the same line: $$inline$$

  Block equations are isolated by two newlines above and below, and newlines between the delimiters and the equation (even in lists):

  $$
  block
  $$

  Use LaTeX commands for symbols as much as possible such as $$\vert$$ or $$\ast$$. For instance, please avoid using the vertical bar symbol, only use \vert for absolute value, and \Vert for norm.

  The syntax for lists is:
  1. $$inline$$ item
  2. item $$inline$$

  Inside HTML environments (like blockquotes), please use the following syntax:

  \( inline \)

  \[
  block
  \]

  like so. Also, HTML markers must be used rather than markdown, e.g. <b>bold</b> rather than **bold**.
