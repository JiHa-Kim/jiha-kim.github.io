  abstract = {This is the first paper of a two-long series in which we study linear generalized inverses that minimize matrix norms. Such generalized inverses are famously represented by the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse (MPP) which happens to minimize the Frobenius norm. Freeing up the degrees of freedom associated with Frobenius optimality enables us to promote other interesting properties. In this Part I, we look at the basic properties of norm-minimizing generalized inverses, especially in terms of uniqueness and relation to the MPP. We first show that the MPP minimizes many norms beyond those unitarily invariant, thus further bolstering its role as a robust choice in many situations. We then concentrate on some norms which are generally not minimized by the MPP, but whose minimization is relevant for linear inverse problems and sparse representations. In particular, we look at mixed norms and the induced \${\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}p {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}q\$ norms. An interesting representative is the sparse pseudoinverse which we study in much more detail in Part II. Next, we shift attention from norms to matrices with interesting behaviors. We exhibit a class whose generalized inverse is always the MPP-even for norms that normally result in different inverses-and a class for which many generalized inverses coincide, but not with the MPP. Finally, we discuss efficient computation of norm-minimizing generalized inverses.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we carefully examine the structure of the gradient of an operator norm on a finite-dimensional matrix space. In particular, we derive concise and useful representations for an operator norm and its subgradient, which refine existing results in this area of study. We further use the derived representations to formulate and prove a criterion of an operator norm, the first of its kind, to the best of our knowledge. It essentially states that a matrix norm is an operator norm if and only if the set of its gradients is the set of the outer products of vectors from each pair of the Cartesian product of two vector sets. We also provide several handy tests, based on this criterion, which in certain cases help to determine whether a matrix norm is an operator norm or not. In addition, we generalize our theoretical developments to higher dimensions, i.e. for injective norms on tensor spaces.},
