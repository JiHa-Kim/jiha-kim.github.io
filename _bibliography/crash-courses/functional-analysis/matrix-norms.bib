  abstract = {In this paper, we fully characterize the duality mapping over the space of matrices that are equipped with Schatten norms. Our approach is based on the analysis of the saturation of the H{\textbackslash}"older inequality for Schatten norms. We prove in our main result that, for \$p{\textbackslash}in (1,{\textbackslash}infty)\$, the duality mapping over the space of real-valued matrices with Schatten-\$p\$ norm is a continuous and single-valued function and provide an explicit form for its computation. For the special case \$p = 1\$, the mapping is set-valued; by adding a rank constraint, we show that it can be reduced to a Borel-measurable single-valued function for which we also provide a closed-form expression.},

  abstract = {The matrix p {$\rightarrow$} q norm is a fundamental quantity appearing in a variety of areas of mathematics. This quantity is known to be efficiently computable in only a few special cases. The best known algorithms for approximately computing this quantity with theoretical guarantees essentially consist of computing the p {$\rightarrow$} q norm for p, q where this quantity can be computed exactly or up to a constant, and applying interpolation. We analyze the matrix 2 {$\rightarrow$} q norm problem and provide an improved approximation algorithm via a simple argument involving the rows of a given matrix. For example, we improve the best-known 2 {$\rightarrow$} 4 norm approximation from m1/8 to m1/12. This insight for the 2 {$\rightarrow$} q norm improves the best known p {$\rightarrow$} q approximation algorithm for the region p {$\leq$} 2 {$\leq$} q, and leads to an overall improvement in the bestknown approximation for p {$\rightarrow$} q norms from m25/128 to m3-2{\textsurd}2.},
