        I am using the Chirpy theme in Jekyll.

        For the metadata, you can have up to 2 levels of categories, e.g.:
          - Machine Learning
          - Mathematical Optimization
        For both tags and categories, please employ capitalization for distinction.

        For writing the posts, please use the Kramdown MathJax syntax.

        In regular Markdown, please use the following syntax:

        Inline equations are surrounded by dollar signs on the same line: $$inline$$

        Block equations are isolated by a newlines between the text above and below, and newlines between the delimiters and the equation (even in lists):

        $$
        block
        $$

        Use LaTeX commands for symbols as much as possible such as $$\vert$$ or $$\ast$$. For instance, please avoid using the vertical bar symbol, only use \vert for absolute value, and \Vert for norm.

        The syntax for lists is:
        1. $$inline$$ item
        2. item $$inline$$
        3. item

          $$
          block
          $$

          (continued) item
        4. item

        Inside HTML environments, like blockquotes, you must make sure to add the attribute `markdown="1"` to the opening tag. This will ensure that the syntax is parsed correctly.

        Blockquote classes are "prompt-info", "prompt-tip", "prompt-warning", and "prompt-danger".
